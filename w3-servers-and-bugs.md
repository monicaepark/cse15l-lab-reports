# Tutorial: How to create servers and troubleshoot bugs
a quick introduction to how to set up a server, as well as deal with failure-inducing inputs through jUnit testing

In this week's lab report, we'll be creating a server called `StringServer` to learn about URLhandlers and servers. After that, we will explore how to find and fix bugs in code by analyzing different inputs, symoptoms, and fixes to our code.

## Part 1: let's get started with StringServer!
To begin, every student created a fork of the provided repository ([click here](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet)), which contains an implementation of the URL handler interface that we needed to create the server. From here, we forked the repository, created a clone in github desktop, then opened the folder in VS Code. From here, I used the provided NumberServer template to craft my StringServer.
